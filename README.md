# 🌐 Web-Based Integrated Development Environment (Online Code Editor)

## 📌 Overview

The **Web-Based Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a lightweight, browser-based coding platform designed to simplify front-end web development. It enables users to write, test, and manage **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** projects in real time without requiring complex local installations.

This platform provides an integrated workspace with **live preview**, **multi-file management**, **automatic saving**, and **secure sandbox execution**, making it ideal for students, beginners, and developers who want to practice, experiment, and prototype web applications efficiently.
